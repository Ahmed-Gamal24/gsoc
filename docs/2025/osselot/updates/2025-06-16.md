# Week 2

*(June 10, 2025 - June 16, 2025)*

## Meeting 2

*(June 12, 2025)*

## Attendees

* [Vaibhav Sahu](https://github.com/Vaibhavsahu2810)
* [Jan Altenberg](https://github.com/JanAltenberg)

## Discussions

* Added a new **“Reuse from OSSelot”** section to the upload page’s Reuse Configuration tab, including all necessary frontend changes for selecting and downloading OSSelot reports.
* Jan recommended using OSSelot’s own REST API (instead of the GitHub API) to fetch package versions and SPDX data.
* Jan will present my changes to the OSSelot contributors for feedback; I’ll incorporate their suggestions in the next iteration.

## Updates

1. **Analyzed the existing Reuse Configuration workflow**

   * Traced how the upload page currently handles reuse settings.
2. **Implemented the “Reuse from OSSelot” UI**

   * Created the frontend layout and interactions.
   * Screenshots:

3. **Explored OSSelot’s data endpoints**

   * Reviewed the JSON schema at `https://github.com/Open-Source-Compliance/package-analysis/tree/main/analysed-packages` to understand how version lists and SPDX payloads are structured.
4. **Built an `OsselotHelper` utility**

   * Implemented methods to fetch available versions and download the corresponding SPDX report for a given package.

## Plan for Next Week
1. Deep dive into the Report-Import agent: map out its current workflow for ingesting external reports.
2. Integrate OSSelot reports into the agent: adapt the Report-Import logic to accept and process OSSelot-sourced SPDX files.
3. Incorporate contributor feedback: review suggestions from OSSelot maintainers and refine API integration and frontend behavior.
4. Switch fully to the OSSelot API: remove any remaining GitHub API calls and ensure all version/SPDX fetches use the official OSSelot endpoints.
