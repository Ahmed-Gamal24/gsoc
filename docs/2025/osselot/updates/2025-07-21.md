# Week 7

*(July 15, 2025 – July 21, 2025)*

## Meeting 7

*(July 18, 2025)*

### Attendees

* [Vaibhav Sahu](https://github.com/Vaibhavsahu2810)
* [Jan Altenberg](https://github.com/JanAltenberg)
* [Shaheem Azmal M MD](https://github.com/shaheemazmalmmd)

### Discussions

* Walked through heartbeat implementation and memory-aware parallelization logic.
* Discussed challenges with SIGTERM signal handling for agent cancellation.
* Shaheem shared helpful documentation on process signal handling strategies in Python.
* Reviewed improvements in process management and configuration defaults.

## Updates

  * Heartbeat functionality is now fully integrated and working as intended for all worker processes.
  * Removed hardcoded memory limit configuration.
  * Implemented a dynamic adjustment mechanism that reduces the number of worker processes based on available system memory.
  * Lowered the default number of parallel jobs to a safer.
  * Began work on capturing `SIGTERM` to cleanly shut down all worker processes when the agent is canceled.
  * Facing some technical challenges in implementation—discussed with Shaheem and received relevant documentation for further debugging.

## Plan for Next Week

1. Finalize and fully implement shutdown behavior when a user cancels the agent (SIGTERM handling).
2. Ensure job status and disclaimers are properly reflected in the **Job View** UI.
