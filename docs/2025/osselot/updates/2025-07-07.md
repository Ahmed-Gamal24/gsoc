## Meeting 5

_(July 4, 2025)_

### Attendees

- [Vaibhav Sahu](https://github.com/Vaibhavsahu2810)  
- [Jan Altenberg](https://github.com/JanAltenberg)  
- [Shaheem Azmal M MD](https://github.com/shaheemazmalmmd)
- [Oliver Fendt](https://github.com/OliverFendt)

### Discussions

- Reviewed both pull requests for the “Reuse of Clearing Decisions via OSSelot Reports” feature.  
- Walked through edge-case test results and fixed minor regressions.  
- Went over Jan’s final suggestions and agreed on merge readiness.  
- Outlined next steps for scancode parallel-scanning implementation.
- Discussed about how we can use FOSSology REST API and FOSSology DUMP for reuse integration

## Updates

- **Feature testing & PR updates**  
  - Thoroughly tested the OSSelot-reuse feature across a range of edge cases with Jan’s help.  
  - Implemented all identified fixes and enhancements.  
  - Held a review meeting to walk through both PRs, incorporated Jan’s final suggestions, and raised the updated PR.  
- **Scancode parallel-scanning exploration**  
  - Began diving into Python’s `multiprocessing` module to design a parallel-scan architecture.  
  - Drafted initial sketches of worker pool management and heartbeat integration.

## Plan for Next Week

1. Prototype a multiprocessing worker pool in the ScanCode agent (`runscanonfiles.py`).  
2. Integrate heartbeat and resource-limit checks into each worker process.  
3. Benchmark single- vs. multi-process performance on sample upload sets.
