# Week 1

*(June 3, 2025 - June 9, 2025)*

## Meeting 1

*(June 3, 2025)*

## Attendees

* [Vaibhav Sahu](https://github.com/Vaibhavsahu2810)
* [Jan Altenberg](https://github.com/JanAltenberg)

## Discussions

* I have completed the first task by introducing a new per-upload configuration flag, **EnableOsselotExport**, and shared a diff comparison showing export files with and without the flag. Jan reviewed the changes and approved them.
* Jan suggested a few refinements: renaming the checkbox for clarity and merging the existing “license comment” flag into the **EnableOsselotExport** option, which I have incorporated.
* While testing large uploads, I hit a “memory limit exceeded” error. Jan recommended updating the `memory_limit` and related PHP settings in `/etc/php/8.2/apache2/php.ini` to resolve this.


## Updates

* Introduces a new per‐upload configuration flag, **EnableOsselotExport**, under  
**Browse → Pfile → Conf → Report Configuration → SPDX Report Settings**. When checked for a given upload, all SPDX-based exports (SPDX-TV, SPDX RDF/XML) and the ReadMeOSS agent adopt OSSelot-compatible behavior.

- **Added per-upload OSSelot toggle**  
  ![Enable OSSelot Export checkbox](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2bb1927d-e280-46d2-b059-e9b6310f1853)  
  Introduced a third checkbox (“Enable OSSelot Export”).

- **SPDX-TV Export**  
  - In **License Information**, list **every** license (including those previously unprefixed).  
  - Rewrite custom licenses as `LicenseRef-See-file.LICENSE` (no `-fossology-`).  
    ![SPDX-TV before/after](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8bb6c601-6d93-43d4-9da2-3227cc8ede3a)  
  - Print each license’s full text. Include any license comments if present.

- **SPDX RDF/XML Export**  
  - Apply identical logic: emit all licenses , strip `-fossology-`, prepend `LicenseRef-` when needed, and include full license text.

- **ReadMeOSS Output**  
  - Strip both `LicenseRef-fossology-` and `LicenseRef-` from each license line.

## Planning for Next Week

* I will start working on my next part of my project where i need to extend the upload page’s reuse settings by adding a “Reuse from OSSelot” section so users can pull in clearing decisions directly from OSSelot reports.
* I’m going to dive into the Report-Import agent’s code and workflow to understand how it ingests external reports, then adapt that logic for OSSelot-sourced data.
* Map out OSSelot’s REST API—identifying the endpoints for version metadata and RDF/XML report files—so I can fetch and integrate those artifacts programmatically.
