# Week 6

*(July 8, 2025 – July 14, 2025)*

## Meeting 6

*(July 11, 2025)*

### Attendees

* [Vaibhav Sahu](https://github.com/Vaibhavsahu2810)
* [Jan Altenberg](https://github.com/JanAltenberg)

### Discussions

* Demonstrated the working prototype of parallelized `ScanCode` scanning within FOSSology.
* Discussed runtime behavior with multiple workers and how resource constraints are enforced.
* Reviewed performance benchmarks from busybox test uploads.
* Collected feedback on user-configurable CLI arguments, some bugs while testing and their integration.

## Updates

* **Parallel ScanCode implementation completed**

  * Fully implemented multiprocessing support in `runscanonfiles.py`.
  * Introduced CLI parameters for customization:
    parser.add_argument("--parallel", type=int, default=1, help="Number of parallel processes (will be adjusted based on available memory)")
    parser.add_argument("--nice-level", type=int, default=10, help="Process nice level (0-19)")
    parser.add_argument("--max-tasks", type=int, default=1000, help="Max tasks per worker process")
    parser.add_argument("--heartbeat-interval", type=int, default=60, help="Heartbeat interval in seconds")
  * Enforced memory and CPU resource limits for each worker process using OS-level controls.

* **Performance testing**

  * Tested using busybox-1.36.1.tar.bz2 uploads.
  * Scanning time improved drastically — from **\~12 minutes to just \~4 minutes**.
  * Below are side-by-side comparisons:

    **Single-process run**

    **Parallelized run (4 processes)**

## Plan for Next Week

1. Avoid starting worker threads if available memory is too low. Ensure threads gracefully shut down if they don’t receive sufficient memory (without hard memory limits).
2. Implement proper cleanup to ensure all worker processes terminate when the user cancels the agent.
3. Reduce the default number of parallel jobs to a safer baseline.
4. Finalize and verify heartbeat handling for worker monitoring.
