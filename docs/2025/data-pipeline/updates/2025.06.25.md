### Engagements
* This week i began the migration of the scripts into a pipeline that can be triggered through Github actions. As at the time of writing this, The available (prepared) script are;
  - Fossology server fetching script
  - Applied preprocessing script
  - Splitting of data 
  
* I created a `pipeline.yml` file and applied the above script preprocessing and Data spliting script into the pipeline, and included the ability to download 
the output from each script from the logs while it's performing the triggered GitHub actions.
* I was able to deploy this into my GitHub repository to allow me to test this feature and changes separately on my own GitHub Actions before going ahead to create a Pull Request.

## Meeting Discussion:
* In the meeting, i had the opportunity to discuss with the mentor on how i went through the task to achieve this Goal
* I had the opportunity to show them the pipeline related script, its code, it applications in my repository, and how the code works sequentially.
* I also got the opportunity to show them the demo of the pipeline line on GitHub, ranging from starting the pipeline through GitHub action, to checking out the logs, downloading the output artifacts, till all processes finishes.
* We also talked about getting a dataset for us to train our model for modification and improvement.


## Subsequent Steps
* I will continue with the subsequent task on the list, which is the application of the pre-written script to the pipeline.
