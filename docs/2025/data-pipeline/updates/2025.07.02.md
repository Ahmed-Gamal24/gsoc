# WEEK 5
*(July 02, 2025)*

## Attendees:
- [Ayush Kumar Bhardwaj](https://github.com/hastagAB)
- [Shaheem Azmal M MD](https://github.com/shaheemazmalmmd)

### Engagements
* This week I went ahead with the pre-written decluttering script application into the pipeline.
* I started by trying out the script to check what our expected output should be, as this will give us an insight of our decluttered output
* While experimenting with examples and trying out the above, I realized the decluttering script and features isn't much effective in general.
* I set out to include some little regex into the decluttering script to increase its effectiveness a little, but this is constrained as copyright text doesn't have a set of rules they follow, there by the text we used to try this out might not apply to other text.
  
* I integrated the available pre-written script additionally into the pipeline

## Meeting Discussion:
* In this week meeting I discussed with the mentors about the task and what I discovered from my applications of the declutter script.
* I informed them and showed them the output I got from an example text which I also test it for them live for confirmation
* I also went ahead to show them the output I got from the modified script I wrote with additional regex rules, and we compared this against each other.
* I was instructed to now create a PR on the work I have done so far on the ongoing project, and submit it on the Safaa main repository.

## Subsequent Steps
* I will be proceeding on getting some few dataset from the mentors to have data for training and carry out some experiment about our model modifications and improvement task.
