*(June 16, 2025)*

### Attendees

- [Prakash Mishra](https://github.com/Prakash-Mishra-9ghz)
- [Kaushlendra Pratap](https://github.com/Kaushl2208)
- [Shaheem Azmal M MD](https://github.com/shaheemazmalmmd)

### Discussion

- Walked through the ORT codebase and explained my understanding of its architecture.
- Discussed how NOMOS could fit into ORT’s scanner framework.
- Mentor confirmed that the current understanding was on the right track and suggested moving forward with developing a scanner plugin.
- Agreed to prepare a working demo of the plugin for the next sync meeting.

### Progress

- Continued development of the NOMOS scanner integration within ORT.
- Focused this week on implementing the logic to trigger a NOMOS scan via the ORT scanner plugin interface.
- Opened a [discussion issue in the ORT repository](https://github.com/oss-review-toolkit/ort/issues/10488) to outline the proposed integration approach and gather community feedback.
- Raised a technical question regarding whether NOMOS can be embedded within ORT or must remain an external dependency.

### Next Steps

- Begin integrating result parsing to align NOMOS output with ORT’s expected scanner result format.
- Add error handling, logging, and start implementing initial test coverage.
- Prepare a working demo to present during the next sync meeting.
