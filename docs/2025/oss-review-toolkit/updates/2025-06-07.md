### Discussion

- Attended the first sync meeting with mentors to plan the initial phase of ORT and FOSSology integration.
- Mentors suggested reviewing the ORT developer guide and understanding how tools like ScanCode integrate with ORT.
- With a basic understanding now in place, I’ve identified specific tasks I’ll start working on to begin the work in the upcoming weeks.


### Progress

- Read through the ORT developer guide to understand its architecture and how scanner integrations are structured.
- Reviewed documentation for ScanCode to learn from existing scanner integrations.
- Interacted with the ORT community via Slack to introduce myself and seek guidance. The community shared helpful documentation.
- Mentor also advised brushing up on Kotlin, as ORT is primarily written in it. Spent time revisiting Kotlin basics and common patterns used in the project.


### Next Steps

- Continue studying relevant plugins and Kotlin code to guide implementation.
- Raise any blockers in the next sync meeting or community channels.
