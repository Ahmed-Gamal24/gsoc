# Week 02 Meetings and Activities

## Integration of ORT with FOSSology Sync Meeting 2

*(June 9, 2025)*

### Attendees

- [Prakash Mishra](https://github.com/Prakash-Mishra-9ghz)
- [Kaushlendra Pratap](https://github.com/Kaushl2208)

### Discussion

- Participated in the second weekly sync meeting with mentor.
- Shared updates on my interaction with the ORT community and the guidance I received around integrating external scanners.
- Brought up a key question about how Nomos works as a standalone tool and whether it can be invoked directly.
- Mentor pointed me to the right resources for understanding Nomos as a standalone tool — including how to build it, use its flags, and interpret its output.

### Progress
- Successfully built Nomos as a standalone tool on my local system.
- Tested Nomos independently on sample files to understand its CLI interface and license detection capabilities.
- Ran Nomos with different flags to evaluate its functionality and output formats:
  - `-J`: Produces output in **JSON**, ideal for structured parsing.
  - `-S`: Outputs highlighting information in **plain text**, showing the locations of detected licenses and keywords within files — including details like the position (at), length, and index of each match
  - `-l`: Ensures full file paths are included in the output.
  - `-c` / `-d`: Used for specifying config and scan directories respectively.
- This hands-on testing gave me a clear idea of how to invoke Nomos programmatically and parse its results for integration.

### Next Steps

- Begin creating the initial skeleton or wrapper code to invoke Nomos from within the ORT scanning pipeline.
- Continue referring to existing ORT scanner plugin implementations for structure and integration best practices.
