# Week 4

_(June 24, 2025 â€“ June 30, 2025)_

## Meeting 1

**Date:** June 24, 2025  
**Attendees:**

- [Harshit Gandhi](https://github.com/harshitg927)
- [Kaushlendra](https://github.com/Kaushl2208)
- [Sushant](https://github.com/its-sushant)
- [Soham](https://github.com/soham4abc)
- [Shaheem Azmal M MD](https://github.com/shaheemazmalmmd)

## Summary

- Provided a detailed analysis of the pull request submitted by Aditya for my project.
- It was decided that I will proceed with the implementation based on the work I had already completed.
- Demonstrated the current progress on the frontend development.
- Received UI-related suggestions from Shaheem for further improvements.

### Changes Suggested

- Users should be able to associate multiple licenses with a single text phrase.
- The "Add Text Phrase" form should be updated to include a button that enables users to fetch data from the license_ref_bulk table. Users can then modify the pulled data as needed before submitting it to the database.

## Progress

I worked on implementing the changes suggested by Shaheem in the weekly technical call. To implement these changes, I completely overhauled the system to support multiple license associations. This wasn't just a simple UI change - it required rethinking the whole database structure and rebuilding a lot of the backend logic.

### Associate Multiple License Feature

**Database Changes:**
The biggest change was moving from a single foreign key relationship to a proper many-to-many setup. I had to:
- Remove the `rf_fk` column from the `custom_phrase` table 
- Create a new `custom_phrase_license_map` junction table
- Add proper indexes for performance
- Set up CASCADE delete behavior so everything stays clean

**Backend Improvements:**
I spent a lot of time refactoring the `AdminCustomTextManagement` controller. The tricky part was making sure all the database operations work correctly with multiple licenses while keeping everything transaction-safe. I added:
- A new `getAssociatedLicenses()` method to fetch all licenses for a phrase
- Complete rewrite of `savePhrase()` with proper transaction handling
- Enhanced `getPhrasesTableData()` to show comma-separated license lists
- Better error handling with rollback capabilities

**UI/UX Enhancements:**
The user interface got a major upgrade. I replaced the basic dropdown with a nice Select2 multi-select that has search functionality. Users can now easily find and select multiple licenses instead of being stuck with just one.

### Import from Bulk Data Feature

I added was the ability to import data from existing bulk license sources. I created a modal dialog that lets users browse through all the bulk data, search through it, and import it directly into their custom text forms. It automatically fills in all the fields - text, acknowledgements, comments, and associated licenses.
To implement this I had to:
- Write a comprehensive SQL query that joins multiple tables
- Add real-time search functionality across all fields
- Handle the form population with JavaScript
- Make sure the modal closes nicely after import

### New Agent Integration

I also started working on creating files for the new agent (Kotoba - placeholder name for the new agent)
I did this now to add the checkboxes in the uploads page for analysis and decider functionality for the new agent.
Addition of two separate checkboxes allows users to either use the agent only for analysis or also decide files according to the findings of the new agent.

### Files Created/Modified
