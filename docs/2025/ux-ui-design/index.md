## Project Title

FOSSology UX and UI Redesign

## What’s the project about?

This project aims to redesign the FOSSology interface with a user-centered design approach that enhances usability and accessibility. The redesign will focus on improving the navigation, making it easier for users to find what they need and complete tasks more efficiently. Enhancing visual hierarchy, and ensuring consistent formatting, we will create a more intuitive experience. A scalable, reusable design system will be developed to ensure that the platform can grow and evolve in the future. Iterative testing and user feedback will guide the design process, ensuring that the final result meets user expectations and improves their overall experience with FOSSology.

## What should be done?

### Evaluating the Current Interface

Identifying usability issues through a systematic analysis of FOSSology’s current interface using these methods:

- **Cognitive Testing - VIMM Model:**
    Evaluating cognitive load in interactions, including visual, intellectual, memory, and motor effort required for common tasks.

- **Usability Analysis - Heuristic Principles:**
    Analysing the interface with Jakob Nielsen's 10 usability heuristics to identify violations such as inconsistency, lack of feedback, or poor error handling etc, and recognize areas of improvement.

- **Accessibility Analysis - Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG):**
    Assessing the interface against WCAG standards, including color contrast, keyboard navigation, and form accessibility to ensure an inclusive user experience.

### Understanding User Needs and Pain Points
Identifying key users and their core tasks, gathering qualitative feedback on existing frustrations through interviews and surveys, and mapping out areas of improvement to guide the redesign process.

### Defining Redesign Requirements
Categorizing needs or pain points based on impact (high/medium/low) and establishing design requirements in alignment with them to ensure a structured redesign approach.

### Creating Workflows and Wireframes/Mockups
Ideating on design requirements and creating low-fidelity wireframes, then moving to high-fidelity UI mockups for early feedback. Then making clickable prototypes to demonstrate improved workflows and UI elements.

### Establishing a Design System
Standardizing typography, colors, spacing, and iconography to create a cohesive visual identity. Creating reusable UI components for consistency and easy development. This will ensure scalability and streamline future enhancements.

### Reiterate and Refine with Feedback
Engaging with users and stakeholders to gather feedback, validate improvements, and identify overlooked issues. Then iterating on designs based on feedback to enhance usability.
