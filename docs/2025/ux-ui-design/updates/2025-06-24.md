## Discussion Points
- We discussed why using FOSSology’s brand red for CTAs and interactive elements could be problematic. Since red is typically associated with errors or warnings, using it for everyday interactions might confuse users or create unnecessary tension. We agreed it’s better reserved for alerts and critical states. A calmer, more neutral color—likely a shade of blue—is being considered for CTAs to convey trust and action without alarming users.
- There was an in-depth discussion around the different secondary navigation bar layouts we’ve been exploring. Some felt too cramped, especially on smaller screens, while others lacked clarity or visual balance. We talked through which patterns might scale well, how much flexibility we need, and what kind of constraints we should design within to keep things clean and usable.

## Activities Completed
- Audited the current color usage across the FOSSology UI and documented it. Ran accessibility checks based on usage context (text, icons, background), and adjusted colors where contrast ratios fell short of standards.
- Added a clear breakdown of the grid system and responsive breakpoints in the design system to guide layout behavior across devices.
- Created and exported custom icons in multiple sizes to suit different contexts within the new design. These icons have been integrated into the design system.

## Next Steps
- Continue expanding the design system by finalizing a typographic scale and documenting all completed header components, including interaction behaviors.
- Begin designing an additional core page in parallel with refining the secondary navigation bar, allowing us to cover more screens and components within the timeline.
- Iterate further on the secondary navigation bar based on internal feedback-focus on cleaner structure, space-efficient design, and visual consistency with the rest of the interface.
