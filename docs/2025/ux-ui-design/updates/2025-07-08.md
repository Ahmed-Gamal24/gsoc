## Discussion Points
- Finalized the placement of breadcrumbs in relation to the secondary navigation bar. Discussed whether breadcrumbs should always be visible or collapsible, considering their role in helping users navigate through nested sections.
- Finalized the layout, size, and behavior of the secondary navigation bar, ensuring it aligns with content structure, remains visually balanced, and functions intuitively across different screen sizes.
- Reviewed and wrapped up the design for the Search page, confirming that all components behave as intended and follow consistent interaction patterns.

## Activities Completed
- Applied all feedback to the secondary navigation bar, adjusting its placement and reducing visual clutter by limiting the number of options shown upfront; finalized the design.
- Refined the Search page design by incorporating feedback, especially on the accordion component, ensuring it is accessible, clean, and consistent with the rest of the UI; marked this page as complete.
- Documented core components - Header, Footer, and Alert messages - in the design system, including usage guidelines, interaction states, and integration notes to support consistent implementation.

## Next Steps
- Begin documentation of the secondary navigation bar and Search page components in the design system, clearly outlining their intended use, responsive behavior, and all state variations.
- Kick off design work on the "Schedule an Analysis" page, starting with basic components like checkboxes, inputs, and layout structure.
- Start analyzing and ideating on the Data Table component reviewing existing patterns, identifying pain points, and exploring cleaner, more scalable design options.
