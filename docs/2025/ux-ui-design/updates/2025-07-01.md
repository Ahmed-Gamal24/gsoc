# Week 5: Meeting Summary and Activities

**Date:** July 1, 2025

## Attendees
- Devanshi Sachan
- Katharina Ettinger
- Shaheem Azmal M MD
- Amrit Verma
- Gaurav Mishra
- Kaushlendra Pratap
- Soham Banerjee
- Tiyasa Kundu

## Discussion Points
- Reviewed updated versions of the secondary navigation bar, evaluating whether they meet layout constraints and usability expectations. Key concerns included visual heaviness, the number of visible options, and how to reduce cognitive load without losing functionality.
- Introduced a new shade of blue into the color palette, derived from the blue used in table components across the existing FOSSology UI. This aims to create visual continuity while enhancing the new design system.

## Activities Completed
- Reassessed earlier secondary nav bar iterations and incorporated feedback to address issues around visual weight, spacing, and clarity.
- Added both primary and secondary buttons to the design system, covering all interactive states (default, hover, active) and variations (with and without icons).
- Progressed on the Search page design, creating supporting components such as accordions, radio buttons, and form elements tailored to the pageâ€™s structure.
- Designed a full set of alert components - error, warning, info, and success, with variations to support flexible use across different interface contexts.

## Next Steps
- Finalize the Search page layout and ensure all supporting components are fully designed and documented.
- Wrap up and validate the secondary navigation bar design, incorporating final feedback and preparing it for system-wide use.
- Continue documenting all completed components in the design system, clearly outlining their usage, interaction states, and behavioral logic for consistency and easier developer handoff.
