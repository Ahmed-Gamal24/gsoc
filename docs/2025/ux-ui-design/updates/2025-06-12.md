- Shaheem Azmal M MD
- Amrit Verma
- Gaurav Mishra
- Dearsh Oberoi
- Sushant Kumar
- Soham Banerjee
- Tiyasa Kundu

## Discussion Points

- Reviewed ongoing progress on the redesigned header, with a focus on the behavior and consistency of individual components in different states (default, hover, and active).
- Finalized the decision to use ‘shadcn/ui’ Tailwind-based components as a foundational library for faster development, while remaining flexible to customize or build new components where needed.
- Discussed how to ensure design scalability by keeping components modular so they can be reused in other parts of the interface like sidebars, tables, or modals.
- Discussions on designing the secondary navigation bar and emphasize on the need for visual references to support future design conversations.

## Activities Completed

- Began creating custom icons from scratch for consistent usage across the UI redesign.
- Finalized the primary header layout, with working prototypes showing component states such as default, hover, and active; continued prototyping dropdowns, including multi-level behavior.
- Initiated the creation of a design system, starting with grid structure, spacing scale, and breakpoints for responsive behavior.
- Designed alternative versions of the FOSSology logo including a simplified logomark and a secondary version that could be used in compact interfaces.

## Next Steps

- Evaluate and finalize a typeface that supports FOSSology's open-source values (e.g., OFL-licensed or LGPL-compatible) and complements the redesigned UI style.
- Wrap up all header components, including interactive elements like dropdowns and user menus, and move into designing the secondary navigation bar.
- Share the current progress on heuristic evaluations to get early feedback from the community and mentors.
- Expand the design system further by adding a defined color palette (with accessibility checks like contrast ratios), typography scale, and reusable spacing tokens.
