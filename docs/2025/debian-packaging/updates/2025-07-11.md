# Week 1


## Debian Packaging Progress

This week focused on setting up a clean Debian packaging workflow for Fossology and beginning the actual packaging work using `git-buildpackage (gbp)`.

- Cloned the [Fossology Salsa repository](https://salsa.debian.org/fossology-team/fossology) using `gbp`, including the `upstream`, `pristine-tar`, and `master` branches.
- Imported the upstream tarball (`fossology_4.5.1.orig.tar.gz`) via `gbp import-orig`.
- Cleaned and updated the `debian/control` file to list all binary packages properly with accurate descriptions and dependencies.

## Meeting 1

**Date:** Jul 10, 2025

This was a community-wide meeting with contributors and organization admins. Each GSoC contributor gave a short summary of their progress so far. I shared an overview of my packaging work, including the repo setup, how I’m using `gbp`, and how I’m building multiple `.deb` packages for Fossology.

## Meeting 2

**Date:** Jul 10, 2025

This was a focused technical meeting with mentors. I walked them through my progress in detail, including how I handled the upstream tarball, debian/control cleanup and PHP dependency setup.

## Planning Next Week

For Week 2, I plan to:

- checking composer.json to determine which depends I need to package.
- creating packages for the depends that do not exist as official debian packages.
