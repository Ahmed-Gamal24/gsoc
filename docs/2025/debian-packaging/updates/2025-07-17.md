# Week 2

## Debian Packaging Progress

This week, I focused on handling PHP Composer dependencies required by Fossology and advancing the packaging process:

- After reviewing `composer.json`, I identified 10 dependencies that are not available as Debian packages.
- **Created 10 PHP dependency packages** with versions matching Fossology's requirements:
    - `firebase-php-jwt` (v6.3.0)
    - `phpoffice-phpword` (0.18.3)
    - `php-guzzlehttp-guzzle` (7.5.0)
    - `phpoffice-phpspreadsheet` (1.29.7)
    - `php-league-oauth2-client` (2.6.1)
    - `php-container-interop` (1.2.0)
    - `php-slim-symfony-di-container` (1.0.3)
    - `phpoffice-common` (1.0.5)
    - `php-slim-psr7` (1.4.1)
    - `php-twbs-bootstrap` (4.1.0)

- **Filed ITPs** (Intent To Package) for all created packages, following Debian policy and ensuring transparency in the packaging process. Here are the details:

    - `firebase-php-jwt` ([ITP #1109343](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=1109343))
    - `php-container-interop` ([ITP #1109356](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=1109356))
    - `php-slim-symfony-di-container` ([ITP #1109357](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=1109357))
    - `phpoffice-common` ([ITP #1109359](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=1109359))
    - `phpoffice-phpword` ([ITP #1109360](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=1109360))
    - `php-slim-psr7` ([ITP #1109364](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=1109364))
    - `php-guzzlehttp-guzzle` ([ITP #1109365](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=1109365))
    - `phpoffice-phpspreadsheet` ([ITP #1109367](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=1109367))
    - `php-league-oauth2-client` ([ITP #1109396](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=1109396))
    - `php-twbs-bootstrap` ([ITP #1109400](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=1109400))

- I also sent an email update to the main Fossology ITP ([ITP #924659](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=924659)), summarizing my progress and the status of the new dependency packages.
- Ensured that all 10 packages were built and installed successfully.

## Meeting 1

**Date:** Jul 17, 2025

This meeting was held with the mentor to review the progress on packaging the PHP dependencies. I presented the list of new packages created, discussed the ITP process for each, and received feedback on ensuring compliance with Debian policies. The mentor emphasized the importance of clear documentation and timely uploads to Salsa.

## Meeting 2

**Date:** Jul 17, 2025

A follow-up technical meeting focused on the build and installation status of the new packages. We discussed the successful builds, the process of filing ITPs, and next steps for integrating the packages into the main Fossology packaging workflow. The mentor also advised on best practices for communicating progress to the Debian community, including updates to the main ITP thread.

## Next Steps

- After the mentor updated the main branch in Salsa, my next step is to upload my work to Salsa and create clear documentation for the packaging process.
