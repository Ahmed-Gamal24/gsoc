## Project Title:

Enhancing Debian Packaging for FOSSology

## What's the project about?

FOSSology is a powerful open-source license compliance software system, and making it easily available to Debian users is crucial for its adoption and sustainability. This project aims to enhance the Debian packaging process for FOSSology, ensuring it meets the highest standards of quality, maintainability, and compliance within the Debian ecosystem.

## Project Goals

- **Streamline the Debian packaging workflow** for FOSSology, making it easier to build, test, and maintain.
- **Handle complex dependencies**, especially PHP Composer dependencies, by creating and maintaining proper Debian packages for all required libraries.
- **Ensure full compliance** with Debian policies and best practices, including correct metadata, licensing, and reproducible builds.
- **Improve documentation** for both users and future maintainers, making the packaging process transparent and accessible.
- **Facilitate collaboration** with the Debian and FOSSology communities by following open development practices and communicating progress clearly.

## How will we achieve these goals?

- Audit all FOSSology dependencies and identify any that are missing from Debian repositories, with a special focus on PHP Composer libraries.
- Package missing dependencies according to Debian standards, filing Intent To Package (ITP) bugs and working with Debian mentors to ensure acceptance.
- Refactor and modernize the FOSSology packaging scripts, leveraging tools like `git-buildpackage` and CMake for a cleaner, more maintainable build process.
- Integrate automated testing and continuous integration to catch issues early and ensure package quality.
- Document every step of the process, from dependency packaging to build instructions, so that others can easily reproduce and extend the work.
- Engage with the community through mailing lists, bug trackers, and collaborative platforms like Salsa to gather feedback and foster long-term sustainability.

By achieving these objectives, we aim to make FOSSology a first-class citizen in the Debian ecosystem, benefiting both end users and the broader open source community.
