  - Cloned the Salsa repository using gbp, successfully setting up the master, upstream, and pristine-tar branches.

  - Imported the latest upstream release (v4.5.1) from GitHub using gbp import-orig.

  - Created a working branch enhancing-debian-packaging that combines the debian/ directory from the Salsa repo with the updated upstream release.

  - Compared the control file from GitHub with the one from Salsa using Meld, identifying outdated and missing dependencies.

  - Updated the control file accordingly — the Git history clearly shows the newly added packages and dependencies.

  - Added a corresponding debian/changelog entry.

  - Included a Makefile to prevent build failures when make clean is run

- [Oyewale Abdulsobur](https://github.com/smilingprogrammer)

  - This week I went ahead with the pre-written decluttering script application into the pipeline.

  - I started by trying out the script to check what our expected output should be, as this will give us an insight of our decluttered output

  - While experimenting with examples and trying out the above, I realized the decluttering script and features isn't much effective in general.

  - I integrated the available pre-written script additionally into the pipeline.

  - I have been working on secondery sub level menu here.
