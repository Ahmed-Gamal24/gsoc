- Discussed the shift from React Bootstrap/Material UI to Tailwind CSS and Shadcn UI, weighing pros like performance, flexibility, and better alignment with React Server Components.
- Tailwindâ€™s utility-first approach, ease of customization, and smaller bundle size were key reasons for choosing it over Bootstrap.
