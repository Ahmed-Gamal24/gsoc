### Discussion

- Discussed the potential shift from JavaScript to TypeScript in the FOSSologyUI codebase. After considering everyone's input, the team collectively decided to continue with JavaScript for now to maintain focus and reduce the immediate learning curve.
- Shared progress on the migration effort: successfully migrated and rendered the Header and Footer components in the new Next.js setup.
- Mentors suggested adopting a global CSS structure, replacing the inline styles used in the legacy React codebase for better maintainability and consistency.
- I was also instructed to push my migration work to a separate branch in my [Fork](https://github.com/tiyasakundu/FOSSologyUI) of the FOSSologyUI repository and raise a pull request to track progress and get feedback.
