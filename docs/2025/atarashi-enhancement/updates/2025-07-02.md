# Week 5

*(June 26, 2025 - July 02, 2025)*

## Meeting 1

*(June 30, 2025)*

## Attendees

* [Rajul Jha](https://github.com/rajuljha)
* [Sushant](https://github.com/its-sushant)

## Discussions
* Clarified the decision tree regarding the license-possibility pipeline.
* Discussed how to improve the performance of KeywordAgent.


## Meeting 2

*(July 2, 2025)*

## Attendees

* [Rajul Jha](https://github.com/rajuljha)
* [Shaheem Azmal M MD](https://github.com/shaheemazmalmmd)
* [Ayush](https://github.com/hastagAB)
* [Sushant](https://github.com/its-sushant)

## Discussions

* Completed implementation of the **KeywordAgent** and raised a PR:
  * **PR:** https://github.com/fossology/atarashi/pull/109
* Evaluated KeywordAgentâ€™s performance with and without licenseRef strings.
* Found **performance bottlenecks** due to licenseRef expansion (~1600 keywords).
* Identified **bugs in Nirjas Agent** that forced full file scans, further degrading performance.
  
However, all was not bad,
* Despite challenges, observed significant improvement in certain scenarios:
  * On `No_license_found` files, using only regex-based patterns, **scan time was reduced by ~50%**.


## Results
1. Overall KeywordAgent accuracy:

**The overall accuracy was increased to a whopping 99.6%**

1. Without KeywordAgent being invoked:

1. With KeywordAgent being invoked:

**This led to ~49% increase in speed approximately, which is significant for large codebases.**

1. With 1600 licenseRef keywords:

**This is around 3.7 times more time consuming which is insanely more, which needs to be addressed.**

## Suggested Improvements

1. **Regex Pattern Enhancements**:
   * New patterns proposed:
     ```yaml
     Exception
     -[0-9]+\.[0-9]+
     -only-or-later
     Version\s[0-9]+\.[0-9]+
     Version-[0-9]+\.[0-9]+
     SPDX-License-Identifier
     ```
   * Goal: Reduce dependency on verbose keyword list and increase detection precision.

2. **Nirjas Bug Fixes**:
   * Fixing the bug would allow comment-only scanning, avoiding unnecessary full-text analysis.

3. **Broader Integration Plan**:
   * Outlined future development milestones:
     1. Separate download sources for files.
     2. Fix Nirjas to extract relevant portions only.
     3. Use KeywordAgent to skip non-relevant files based on keyword absence.
     4. Integrate the system with FOSSology.
     5. Handle edge cases and further optimize Nirjas agent.

## Next Steps

* Fix Nirjas comment-extraction bug.
* Finalize updated regex patterns.
* Refactor and optimize KeywordAgent to use refined patterns.
