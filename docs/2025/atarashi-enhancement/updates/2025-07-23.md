# Week 8

*(July 17, 2025 - July 23, 2025)*

## Progress

### Local Setup

* Successfully compiled **FOSSology** on my Mac system using an **Ubuntu VM** set up via **Orbstack**.
* This environment will help with testing and debugging integration-related changes more efficiently.

### Studied Previous Work

* Reviewed and analyzed the existing agent integration pull request:
  * [PR #1634 – Initial Atarashi Agent Work](https://github.com/fossology/fossology/pull/1634)
* Understood how Atarashi can be structured and plugged into the existing agent system in FOSSology.

### Initial Integration Work

* Started working on the **agent-side integration** of Atarashi into FOSSology.
* Made early progress in structuring the directory and adapting agent registration flows.

### Discussions

* Had a **deep-dive discussion** with mentors on:
  * How the **UI components** work in FOSSology.
  * The **rendering and presentation** process for agent results.
  * Best practices for making Atarashi output visible and useful in the web interface.

* Mentors advised me to explore:
  * [PR #2782 – Sample UI Workflow Integration](https://github.com/fossology/fossology/pull/2782)
  * This PR demonstrates how UI elements and views are tied with agent output in FOSSology.

## Other Activities

* Continued working on my talk preparation for **PyCon India 2025**:
  * Topic: *FOSSology CI Scanner*
  * Focused on making it accessible for contributors and new adopters.

## Next Steps

* Continue building the Atarashi agent integration pipeline inside FOSSology.
* Continue working on the **backend testing**, based on insights from PR #2782.
