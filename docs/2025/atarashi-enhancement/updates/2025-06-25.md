# Week 4

*(June 17, 2025 - June 25, 2025)*

## Meeting 1

*(June 25, 2025)*

## Attendees

* [Rajul Jha](https://github.com/rajuljha)
* [Shaheem Azmal M MD](https://github.com/shaheemazmalmmd)
* [Ayush](https://github.com/hastagAB)
* [Sushant](https://github.com/its-sushant)

## Discussions

* Demonstrated the working **KeywordAgent**, built using `SRINGS.in` from the Nomos agent.
* Shared the **evaluator script results** tested on NomosTestFiles â€” yielded **~99.5% accuracy**.
* Debugged cases with true negatives and realized the need for **additional keyword sources**.
* Finalized a **two-stage filtering architecture** for license detection pre-check.
* Walked through **code improvements and refactoring** done on the Atarashi base code.

## KeywordAgent Implementation

Implemented a rule-based keyword detection agent using regex patterns derived from `SRINGS.in`. Keywords included:

```yaml
acknowledg(e|ement|ements)?
agreement
as[\s-]is
copyright
damages
deriv(e|ed|ation|ative|es|ing)
redistribut(e|ion|able|ing)?|distribut(e|ion|able|ing)?
free software
grant
indemnif(i|y|ied|ication|ying)?
intellectual propert(y|ies)?
[^e]liabilit(y|ies)?
licencs?
mis[- ]?represent
open source
patent
permission
public[\s-]domain
require(s|d|ment|ments)?
same terms

source (and|or)? ?binary

warrant(y|ies|ed|ing)?
without (fee|restrict(ion|ed)?|limit(ation|ed)?)
severability clause
```


## Evaluation Results

* Ran the KeywordAgent on **NomosTestFiles**.
* Achieved **~99.5% accuracy**, confirming robustness of regex pattern matching.
* Detected minor edge cases (true negatives) which informed the next steps for keyword expansion.

## Code Improvements

* Refactored parts of the Atarashi codebase:
  * Applied Python best practices (docstrings, function decomposition, consistent naming).
  * Improved error handling and logging in preprocessing and agent workflows.

## Two-Stage Detection Plan

Decided on a layered pre-check system for Atarashi Scanner:

1. **Stage 1:** Match against the **initial keyword list** (from SRINGS.in).
2. **Stage 2:** If Stage 1 fails, match against **license shortnames** and **FOSSology license_ref** strings.
3. If neither stage matches, the file is **skipped** from scanning.
4. If either matches, it is **scanned using Atarashi**.
