# Week 2

*(June 10, 2025 - June 16, 2025)*

## Meeting 1

*(June 11, 2025)*

## Attendees

* [Rajul Jha](https://github.com/rajuljha)
* [Kaushlendra](https://github.com/Kaushl2208)
* [Ayush](https://github.com/hastagAB)
* [Sushant](https://github.com/its-sushant)

## Discussions

* Shared findings from a **comprehensive analysis of the Minerva Dataset**.
* Reviewed dataset characteristics like class imbalance, license frequency, and dataset composition by source.
* Talked about integrating **negative samples** into the dataset, which are currently missing but critical for training robust ML models.
* Presented a **proof of concept for Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH)** and discussed its behavior with varying input lengths.

## Minerva Dataset Analysis

Analyzed multiple dimensions of the Minerva dataset using visualizations. Key insights:

* **Long-tail Distribution**:
  * The cumulative distribution shows that **a small subset of licenses accounts for the majority of files**.
  * Around **200 licenses cover ~80% of the dataset**, confirming a significant skew in class distribution.

* **Boxplots by Source**:
  * Both `Split-DB-Foss-Licenses` and `Split-SPDX-licenses` show similar distributions, though the median file counts differ slightly.
  * Outliers are present in both, indicating a few licenses are over-represented.

* **Heavy Tail in File Counts**:
  * Histogram and KDE of file counts per license shows **a large number of licenses with very few associated files**, while only a few have 500+ files.
  * This reveals severe **class imbalance** which can bias any learning model.

* **Source Composition**:
  * The dataset is **split nearly evenly**: ~54% from `Split-DB-Foss-Licenses`, ~46% from `Split-SPDX-licenses`.

* **Top 15 Licenses by File Count**:
  * Some licenses (e.g., `Hacktivismo`, `Zimbra-1.2`) dominate the dataset.
  * These must be considered while sampling or designing the pre-filtering ML models to **avoid model bias**.

## Updates

* Spent time **exploring and analyzing the Minerva Dataset**.
* Prepared and shared **insightful visualizations** for license frequency, source distribution, and class balance.
* Identified key limitations:
  * Severe **data imbalance** across license classes.
  * **Lack of negative samples** — currently all samples are associated with known licenses, with no explicit “no license” or “non-license” examples.

* Implemented a **proof of concept for Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH)**:
  * Works well when **input text length is similar** to license texts.
  * Struggles when input is **shorter or a subquery**, highlighting the need for **preprocessing strategies** or **text padding**.

## Problems Identified

* Minerva lacks **negative (non-license) samples**, which will hinder the performance of classifiers in real-world noisy environments.
* LSH-based similarity is **length-sensitive**; needs improvement for **partial or paraphrased** inputs.
* Dataset imbalance could lead to **model overfitting** on high-frequency licenses.

## Planning for Next Week

* Begin designing a **dataset augmentation strategy** to introduce negative samples.
* Study in more detail about **Locality Sensitive Hashing**.
* Experiment with **segmenting license texts** and input queries to better suit LSH-based techniques.
* Continue refining the dataset pipeline and class balancing.
