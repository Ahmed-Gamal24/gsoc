## Progress

### Nirjas Bug Fix

* Identified and **fixed the comment extraction bug in Nirjas** that was causing list index out of range on scanning some php files.
* **Reason:** The [readMultilineDiff](https://github.com/fossology/Nirjas/blob/master/nirjas/binder.py#L119) function assumes that every occurrence of the [startSyntax] and [endSyntax] in the file will form a valid pair. However, in the provided PHP file, there might be mismatched or incomplete pairs of `startSyntax` (/*) and `endSyntax` (*/), which causes the IndexError when trying to calculate the difference between [startLine] and [endLine].
* The reason the endLine and startLine length's don't match is because "It is treating the "*/" symbol in the code as a end of a comment."
* **PR Raised:** [fossology/Nirjas#63](https://github.com/fossology/Nirjas/pull/63)

### KeywordAgent Improvements

* Took into account the **review suggestions by Shaheem** and applied the following refinements:
  * Refactored internal logic for clarity and maintainability.
  * Enhanced **regex pattern matching** to reduce false positives and improve precision.
  * Reduced dependency on bloated keyword sets by using smarter patterns.

**Updated Patterns Sample:**
```yaml
\bException\b
-[0-9]+\.[0-9]+
-only-or-later
Version\s[0-9]+\.[0-9]+
Version-[0-9]+\.[0-9]+
\bSPDX-License-Identifier\b
